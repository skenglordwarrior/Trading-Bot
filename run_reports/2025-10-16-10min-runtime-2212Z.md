# 10-Minute Runtime Observability Run — 2025-10-16 22:52Z

## Execution Summary
- **Command:** `timeout 600 python ethereumbotv2.py`
- **Window:** ~10 minutes starting 22:52:19 UTC
- **Outcome:** Bot stayed online, scanned Uniswap v2/v3 blocks continuously, but Etherscan remained unreachable and DexScreener never produced metadata for the one new pair encountered.

## Metrics Timeline
- `pairs_scanned_per_min` fell from 1.0 in the opening minute to 0.0 for the remainder of the run as no additional pools were detected.
- `api_error_rate` reported 1.0 during the first minute because Etherscan connectivity checks failed, then remained 0.0 once lookups were disabled.
- `average_rpc_latency_ms` ranged between ~63 ms and 116 ms, indicating stable node responsiveness.

## Observations
1. **Etherscan health:** Every configured endpoint was unreachable at startup, so the bot disabled Etherscan-based wallet lookups for the session.
2. **Throughput:** The bot processed a new pool once (`pairs_found: 1`) but never obtained DexScreener data, resulting in repeated rechecks and eventual eviction after the third failed attempt.
3. **Alerts:** No zero-throughput or error-rate spike alerts fired after the initial Etherscan disablement; exception counters stayed at zero.

## Recommendations
- Validate network access or credentials for Etherscan hosts; consider adding secondary providers to avoid permanent disablement during runs.
- Investigate DexScreener fetch reliability for brand-new pairs—augment with retries/backoffs or alternative sources to prevent noisy requeues.
- Track recheck queue churn (attempts before eviction) in metrics to make zero-throughput alerts more actionable when new pools stall.
