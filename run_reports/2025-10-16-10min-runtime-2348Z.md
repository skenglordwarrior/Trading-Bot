# 2025-10-16 Bot Runtime Report — 23:48Z Session

## Overview
- **Run window:** 23:48:52Z – 23:58:52Z (10 minutes via `timeout 600 python ethereumbotv2.py`).
- **Objective:** Confirm Etherscan connectivity and observe trading loop health after base URL adjustments.

## Connectivity
- Startup connectivity probes to both configured Etherscan endpoints (`https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1` and legacy `/api?chainid=1`) failed with `Network is unreachable`, forcing Etherscan-dependent features offline for the session.

## Discovery & Processing Timeline
- Blocks processed steadily every ~11 seconds for both v2 and v3 feeds with zero new pools for most cycles.
- Three new pools surfaced on v2:
  - 23:50:52Z — `0x205867Fd51D9312A79d4cc55Ff98659a54c62B04`
  - 23:51:37Z — `0x1eB6A748ed69bE877D7E92f38678Cf9801A4bfc4`
  - 23:56:26Z — `0x665541bAA1796A839a14374a95f7088A93d5eEAa`
- Each discovery immediately requeued due to missing DexScreener metadata; no passes or trades were recorded.

## Rechecks
- `0x2058…` rechecked twice (23:51:53Z & 23:54:53Z) and remained 0/13 on both attempts.
- `0x1eB6…` rechecked twice (23:52:38Z & 23:55:39Z) with identical 0/13 results.
- `0x6655…` saw one recheck at 23:57:28Z, also 0/13.
- Pending recheck queue remained at two or three items throughout, reflecting repeated DexScreener lookup misses.

## Metrics Snapshot
- Periodic metrics frames (~minute cadence) showed:
  - `pairs_scanned_per_min` oscillating between 0.0 and 2.0 as new pools emerged.
  - `api_error_rate` at 0.0–1.0 depending on DexScreener failures (no RPC errors observed; average RPC latency 55–67 ms).
  - Queue depth counters highlighting the persistent recheck backlog without volume-check/passing queues.

## Alerts & Issues
- Continuous `[DexMissing]` warnings underline a dependency on DexScreener availability; no fallback executed.
- No throughput or exception alerts fired, but lack of Etherscan access prevents wallet-level enrichment and related safeguards.

## Recommendations
1. Investigate the container’s network path to `api.etherscan.io` (DNS resolution, outbound firewall, or proxy requirements) since the URL format is correct but connectivity fails.
2. Add explicit DexScreener health probes or cache invalidation metrics to identify why multiple fresh pools lack coverage.
3. Consider enriching metrics with differentiated API error attribution (Etherscan vs. DexScreener) to clarify future incident triage.
