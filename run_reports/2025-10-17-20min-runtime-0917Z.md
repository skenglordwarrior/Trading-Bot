# 2025-10-17 — 20-Minute Runtime Check (09:40–10:00Z)

## Overview
- **Start:** 09:40:15Z
- **End:** 10:00:01Z (timed 20-minute `timeout 1200` run)
- **Focus:** Extended runtime validation of Etherscan connectivity, throughput instrumentation, and alerting over a 20-minute window.

## Key Events
1. Startup confirmed the prioritized Etherscan endpoint on the first attempt, logging sub-second reachability through the proxy configuration.
2. The Uniswap v2/v3 block pollers advanced without discovering any new pools, leaving the trade, pass, and recheck queues empty for the entire window.
3. The metrics emitter raised a zero-throughput alert after ten minutes without candidates, reinforcing that discovery remained idle even as block ingestion continued.

## Metrics Snapshot (per minute emitter)
| Timestamp (Z) | Pairs/min | Trades | Exceptions/min | Queue Depths (passing / volume / rechecks) | API Error Rate | Avg RPC Latency (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 09:41:13 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 133.60 |
| 09:45:13 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 87.09 |
| 09:50:13 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 75.59 |
| 09:55:13 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 84.51 |
| 09:59:13 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 74.22 |

## Alerts & Notices
- Zero-throughput warning triggered at 09:50:13Z once the metrics loop observed ten consecutive minutes without any scanned pairs.

## Observations
- **Etherscan connectivity:** Pre-flight checks succeeded with ~0.84 s latency, confirming the configured `https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1` endpoint remains reachable through the container proxy.
- **Throughput:** Both v2 and v3 watchers processed new blocks roughly every 11 seconds but surfaced no pools; trade, pass, and recheck queues stayed flatlined at zero.
- **Latency:** Runtime metrics kept average RPC latency near 85 ms (peak 134 ms, floor 69 ms) during the 20-minute window despite the empty discovery queues.

## Follow-Ups
- Review discovery data sources or broaden monitored pools to reduce long zero-throughput stretches.
- Consider augmenting alerting with additional context (e.g., last block processed, outstanding discovery tasks) to streamline investigation during idle runs.
