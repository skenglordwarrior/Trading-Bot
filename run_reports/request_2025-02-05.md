# User Request Summary (2025-02-05)

## Pair 0x01dD05779972f0A530b8311F9A94ebB77E2370B4 (CAPTAIN/WETH)
- **Would it be detected?** The pair shows a creation timestamp of 2025-12-02 (block 23,925,833), which is outside the currently scanned historical window. The real-time ingestion would only surface it once those blocks arrive on-chain, so it would not appear in existing backtest snapshots.
- **Liquidity lock:** Etherscan-based lock probe reports liquidity locked at ~99.0% coverage with a lock starting 2025-12-02 13:39:35 UTC and unlocking 2025-12-18 13:30:00 UTC. That provides short-term protection (~16 days) but not a long-term lock.
- **Risk posture:** No automated contract analysis snapshot exists for this pair in the repo. Manual review flags elevated risk due to (a) unusual future-dated creation timestamp reported by DexScreener/Etherscan, (b) short lock duration, and (c) rapid price/volume swings (DexScreener 24h price change >100k%). Full static analysis (renounce/owner powers/whitelist checks) would be required for a numeric score.

## Test 4.txt log review
- No `Test 4.txt` file is present in the repository, so no runtime log could be inspected for stalling or other issues. Please provide the file path or contents to review the run.

## Backtest run
- Command: `python -m backtesting --limit 5`
- Outcome: Completed successfully using the latest `backtests/passing_snapshots.jsonl`; produced five results for pair `0xfd949Be65054d11E10f92eB5b8bdB763b25FC518` with adjusted PnL multiples ranging from x3367 to x4361 and zero recorded drawdown (data flagged as truncated at 7–9 bars).

## Testing feedback summary
- Backtest execution succeeded without stalls or crashes.
- Pending further log evidence, no additional runtime regressions were observed in this request.
