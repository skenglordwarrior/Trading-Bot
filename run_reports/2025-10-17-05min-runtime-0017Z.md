# 2025-10-17 — 5-Minute Runtime Check (00:16–00:21Z)

## Overview
- **Start:** 00:16:56Z
- **End:** 00:21:49Z (timed 5-minute `timeout 300` run)
- **Focus:** Validate restored Etherscan reachability after proxy-aware `aiohttp` changes.

## Key Events
1. Startup verified the prioritized Etherscan endpoint on the first attempt with ~490 ms latency, confirming reachability through the container proxy.
2. V2/V3 block watchers advanced smoothly, maintaining <75 ms average RPC latency.
3. One new pair (`0x2c530aAE08187e2b7C5a315805F83cb8179c2D03`) surfaced without DexScreener coverage; it was requeued for a later metadata retry.
4. No trades were placed, and the queues stayed empty after the requeue event.

## Metrics Snapshot (per minute emitter)
| Timestamp (Z) | Pairs/min | Trades | Exceptions/min | Queue Depths (passing / volume / rechecks) | API Error Rate | Avg RPC Latency (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00:17:53 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 90.55 |
| 00:18:53 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 69.11 |
| 00:19:53 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 73.10 |
| 00:20:53 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0.0 | 73.13 |

## Observations
- **Etherscan:** The pre-flight endpoint check succeeded immediately and no subsequent Etherscan errors were logged.
- **Throughput:** Uniswap v2/v3 block scanning held steady but surfaced only a single candidate; monitor DexScreener coverage for that pool.
- **Alerts:** No zero-throughput or error spike alerts triggered during this window.

## Follow-Ups
- Track whether DexScreener fills data for `0x2c53…` in later runs; if repeated misses persist, consider alternative metadata providers.
- Continue monitoring long-run averages for RPC latency now that proxy routing is active to ensure sustained performance.
